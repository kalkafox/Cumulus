# Cumulus

Cumulus is mostly a personal repository of projects containing some common code that is used for some of the languages I work with. Most of the stuff over the months (as of Oct. 2022) is a bunch of messy C++/Lua/Rust code, which has been part of the learning experience. All of this stuff shouldn't really be used for production.
